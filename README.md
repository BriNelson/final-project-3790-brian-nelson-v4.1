# Brian Nelons Final 3790

## Project Requirements


### 1. Effectively use conditional logic and JavaScript array methods to render large lists.
Two list working right now [Custom foo description](#test)


### 2. Encapsulate your code as VueJS single-file components.
[Components are registered in the App.vue component](src/App.vue)

### 3. Work with the Vue-CLI to create and manage your project within a real development toolset.
Vue cli used

### 4. Properly use Git for your source version control with an established record of at least 4 days of commits each week from October 15th through December 6th.
[Git used for version control maybe not enough commits.](https://github.com/Lazer-lad)

### 5. Allow communication between components using props, custom events, or local store.
Event bus is broken, cant get it to pass anything

### 6. Present a form for user input that provides useful form validation and feedback.

### 7. Create a custom directive and use it on at least one of your components.

### 8. Use a mix of animations and transitions to enhance some aspects of your project.

### 9. Connect to a server using HTTP and display retrieved data (use vue-resource or Axios).

### 10. Provide at least 3 different routes with navigation between them using vue-router.
Routing is in the navigation, coding [here](src\router\index.js)

### 11. Manage your application's state using vuex. 
Used with the login, can be seen [here](https://kind-panini-383726.netlify.com/form). Coding can mostly be seen [here](src\store\index.js)

### 12. Structure, document, and deploy your final project code according to common industry practices.
