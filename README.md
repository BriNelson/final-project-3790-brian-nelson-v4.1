### 2. Encapsulate your code as VueJS single-file components.
[Components are registered in the App.vue component](src/App.vue)

### 3. Work with the Vue-CLI to create and manage your project within a real development toolset.
Vue cli used

### 4. Properly use Git for your source version control with an established record of at least 4 days of commits each week from October 15th through December 6th.
[Git used for version control maybe not enough commits.](https://github.com/Lazer-lad)

### 5. Allow communication between components using props, custom events, or local store.
